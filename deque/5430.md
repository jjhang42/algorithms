# 5430. AC

## Problem

Seonyeong, having nothing to do over the weekend, created a new language called **AC**.  
AC is a language designed to perform operations on integer arrays.  
It has two functions:

- **R** ("Reverse"): Reverses the order of the numbers in the array.
- **D** ("Drop"): Deletes the first number in the array. If the array is empty and a `D` operation is performed, an error occurs.

Functions can be combined and executed in sequence.  
For example, `"AB"` means perform function `A` first, then immediately perform function `B`.  
For example, `"RDD"` means reverse the array, then drop the first two numbers.

Given the initial array and the function sequence to perform, write a program to compute the final result.

## Input

The first line contains the number of test cases **T** (1 ≤ T ≤ 100).

For each test case:

1. The first line contains the function string **p** to be executed.  
   (1 ≤ length of p ≤ 100,000)

2. The next line contains an integer **n** — the number of integers in the array.  
   (0 ≤ n ≤ 100,000)

3. The next line contains the integers in the form `[x1,x2,...,xn]`,  
   where (1 ≤ xi ≤ 100).

The total sum of the lengths of **p** and **n** across all test cases does not exceed 700,000.

## Output

For each test case, print the resulting array after executing the given functions on the input array.  
If an error occurs, print:

```
error
```
