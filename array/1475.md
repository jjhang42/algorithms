## Problem

Dasom just moved into a new apartment next to Eunjin's.  
She wants to decorate her door with plastic number plates showing her room number.

The shop sells plastic numbers in **sets**.  
Each set contains exactly one of every digit from 0 to 9.

Given Dasom's room number, write a program to calculate the **minimum number of sets** she needs to buy to form her room number.
