## Problem

You are given three natural numbers `A`, `B`, and `C`.  
Write a program that calculates `A × B × C` and counts how many times each digit from `0` to `9` appears in the result.

For example, if `A = 150`, `B = 266`, and `C = 427`, then:  
`A × B × C = 150 × 266 × 427 = 17037300`  
In the result `17037300`,  
- digit `0` appears **3 times**  
- digit `1` appears **1 time**  
- digit `3` appears **2 times**  
- digit `7` appears **2 times**

## Input

Three lines are given, each containing a single natural number:  
- First line: `A`  
- Second line: `B`  
- Third line: `C`  

Each number satisfies: `100 ≤ A, B, C < 1000`

---

## Output

Print 10 lines.  
The first line should contain the count of digit `0` in the product `A × B × C`.  
The second line should contain the count of digit `1`, and so on up to digit `9`.
