## Problem

You are given a sequence of `n` **distinct positive integers** `a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ`.  
Each `aᵢ` satisfies: `1 ≤ aᵢ ≤ 1,000,000`.

You are also given a **target number** `x`.  
Your task is to count how many **unique pairs** `(aᵢ, aⱼ)` exist such that:

```
aᵢ + aⱼ = x  and  1 ≤ i < j ≤ n
```

Write a program that finds the number of such pairs.

## Input

- The first line contains the integer `n` — the size of the sequence.  
- The second line contains `n` space-separated integers — the elements of the sequence.  
- The third line contains the target integer `x`.

**Constraints:**  
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000`  
- `1 ≤ x ≤ 2,000,000`

## Output

Print a single integer — the number of unique pairs whose sum is exactly `x`.

## Example

### Input
```
9
5 12 7 10 9 1 2 3 11
13
```

### Output
```
