## Problem

A **stack** is a fundamental data structure frequently used in computer programs.  
It follows the **Last-In First-Out (LIFO)** principle — the last item added is the first one to be removed.

You can generate a sequence by pushing numbers from `1` to `n` (in increasing order) onto a stack, and popping them in a specific order.

Given a target sequence of `n` integers (from `1` to `n`, without duplicates), determine whether this sequence can be produced using only stack operations **push** and **pop**.

If it is possible, print the sequence of operations needed to generate the target.  
If it is not possible, print `NO`.

---

## Input

- The first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000) — the length of the sequence.  
- The next `n` lines each contain an integer between `1` and `n` (inclusive) — the target sequence, in order.  
- All numbers are distinct.

---

## Output

If the target sequence is possible using the stack, output a sequence of operations:

- `+` for a push operation  
- `-` for a pop operation  

Print one operation per line.  
If it is not possible to produce the sequence, print:

```
NO
```

## Hint

In the first example, if you push numbers from 1 to 8 in order, and perform the following sequence of operations:

```
[push, push, push, push, pop, pop, push, push, pop, push, push, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop]
```

you can obtain the desired output sequence:

```
[4, 3, 6, 8, 7, 5, 2, 1]
```
