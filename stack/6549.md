## Problem
A histogram is a figure consisting of several rectangles aligned at the bottom.  
Each rectangle has the same width, but the heights may differ.  
For example, the figure on the left has heights 2, 1, 4, 5, 1, 3, 3, each with a width of 1.

Write a program to find the rectangle with the largest area in the histogram.

## Input
The input consists of multiple test cases.  
Each test case is given on a single line, starting with an integer `n` — the number of rectangles (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000).  
Then `n` integers follow: `h1, h2, ..., hn` (0 ≤ hi ≤ 1,000,000,000), representing the heights of the rectangles from left to right.  
The width of each rectangle is 1.  
The last line of input contains a single `0`, which should not be processed.

## Output
For each test case, output the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.

## Example

**Input**
```
7 2 1 4 5 1 3 3
4 1000 1000 1000 1000
0
```

**Output**
```
8
4000
```
