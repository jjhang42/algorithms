Baekjoon, who is waiting in line for this historic moment, suddenly becomes curious about how many people he can see.

Given the heights of the people standing in line, write a program to calculate the number of pairs who can see each other.

## Input

The first line contains an integer N, the number of people waiting in line. (1 ≤ N ≤ 500,000)

The following N lines each contain the height of one person in nanometers. All heights are less than 2³¹ nanometers.

The people are listed in the order they are standing in line.
