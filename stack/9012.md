# Parentheses

## Problem

A Parenthesis String (PS) is a string consisting only of two parenthesis symbols: `(` and `)`. Among these, a **Valid Parenthesis String** (VPS) is one where the parentheses are correctly matched.

A single pair of parentheses `"()"` is the basic VPS.  
If `x` is a VPS, then the string formed by placing it inside one pair of parentheses, `"(x)"`, is also a VPS.  
If `x` and `y` are VPS, then their concatenation `xy` is also a VPS.

For example:  
- `"(()())()"` and `"((()))"` are VPS.  
- `"(()("`, `"(())()))"`, and `"(()"` are **not** VPS.

Your task is to determine whether the given parenthesis string is a VPS or not. Output `YES` if it is, and `NO` otherwise.

## Input

- The input uses **standard input**.
- The first line contains an integer `T` â€” the number of test cases.  
- Each of the following `T` lines contains one parenthesis string.
- The length of each string is between 2 and 50, inclusive.

---

## Output

- For each test case, output `YES` if the given string is a valid parenthesis string (VPS), otherwise output `NO`.
- Print each result on a separate line.
