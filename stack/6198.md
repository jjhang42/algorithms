## Description
There are **N** buildings in the city.

The building managers are diligent and want to benchmark rooftop gardens of other buildings.

If the height of the **i-th** building is **hᵢ**, and all buildings are arranged in a line from left to right, then the manager of the **i-th** building can only see the rooftops of buildings to the right (i+1, i+2, ..., N).

However, if there is a building taller than or equal to the current one, all buildings after that cannot be seen.

### Example
Let’s consider **N = 6**, and the heights **H = {10, 3, 7, 4, 12, 2}**.

```
            =
=           =
=     -     = 
=     =     =        -> viewing direction
=  -  =  =  =   
=  =  =  =  =  = 
10  3  7  4 12 2     -> building heights
[1][2][3][4][5][6]   -> building numbers
```

- Building 1 sees rooftops of 2, 3, and 4 → **3**
- Building 2 sees none → **0**
- Building 3 sees 4 → **1**
- Building 4 sees none → **0**
- Building 5 sees 6 → **1**
- Building 6 sees none → **0**

Total rooftops that can be seen: **3 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 5**

## Input
- The first line contains a single integer **N** (1 ≤ N ≤ 80,000), the number of buildings.
- The following **N** lines contain one integer **hᵢ** (1 ≤ hᵢ ≤ 1,000,000,000), the height of each building.

## Output
- Print the total number of rooftops that all managers can see.

## Example Input
```
6
10
3
7
4
12
2
```

## Example Output
```
5
```
