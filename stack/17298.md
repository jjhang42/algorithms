## 📝 Problem

You are given a sequence of size **N**, defined as **A = A₁, A₂, ..., Aₙ**. For each element **Aᵢ**, you need to find its **Next Greater Element (NGE(i))**.

The **Next Greater Element of Aᵢ** is the first element to the right of **Aᵢ** that is **greater than Aᵢ**.  
If there is no such element, the Next Greater Element is **-1**.

### 🔍 Example

- For A = `[3, 5, 2, 7]`:  
  NGE(1) = 5, NGE(2) = 7, NGE(3) = 7, NGE(4) = -1  
  → Output: `5 7 7 -1`

- For A = `[9, 5, 4, 8]`:  
  NGE(1) = -1, NGE(2) = 8, NGE(3) = 8, NGE(4) = -1  
  → Output: `-1 8 8 -1`
