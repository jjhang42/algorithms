# Good Word (다국어)

## Problem

During this semester, Pyeongseok is taking an Introduction to Psychology course. On the day the report is due, he accidentally fell asleep while working on it and woke up just one hour before the deadline. Unfortunately, while he was asleep, the keyboard was pressed incorrectly, and all the characters in the report turned into only the letters 'A' and 'B'!

Rather than fixing the report, Pyeongseok decided to abandon it and instead count the number of "good words" in it.

Pyeongseok decided to draw arch-shaped curves over the word to pair the same letters (A with A, B with B). If it is possible to match each letter with exactly one other identical letter without any of the lines crossing, then the word is called a "good word".

Your task is to help Pyeongseok count the number of good words.

## Input

The first line contains the number of words **N** (1 ≤ N ≤ 100).

The next **N** lines each contain a word consisting only of the letters 'A' and 'B'. Each word has a length between 2 and 100,000, and the total length of all words combined does not exceed 1,000,000.

## Output

Print the number of good words.
