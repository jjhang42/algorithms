# Iron Bar

## Problem
We want to cut several iron bars using lasers. For efficient work, the iron bars are stacked from bottom to top, and a laser is fired vertically from above to cut the bars. The arrangement of iron bars and lasers follows these conditions:

1. An iron bar can only be placed on top of a longer iron bar.
2. When placing one bar on top of another, it must be completely contained within the other without overlapping the endpoints.
3. Each iron bar is cut by at least one laser.
4. A laser does not overlap with either endpoint of any iron bar.

The illustration below shows an example that satisfies these conditions. The thick horizontal lines represent iron bars, the dots represent the positions of lasers, and the vertical dashed arrows represent the direction of laser firing.

The arrangement of lasers and iron bars can be expressed from left to right using parentheses as follows:

- A laser is represented by a pair of parentheses "()" with no characters in between. Every "()" pair represents a laser.
- The left endpoint of an iron bar is represented by an opening parenthesis "(", and the right endpoint is represented by a closing parenthesis ")".

In the example, the top two iron bars are cut into 3 and 2 pieces, respectively. In the same manner, all given iron bars are cut into a total of 17 pieces.

Given the parentheses representation of the arrangement of iron bars and lasers, write a program to compute the total number of pieces the iron bars are cut into.

## Input
A single line containing the parentheses representation of the arrangement of iron bars and lasers without spaces. The total number of parentheses will not exceed 100,000.

## Output
Output a single integer â€” the total number of pieces the iron bars are cut into.

## Example

### Input 1
```
()(((()())(())()))(())
```

### Output 1
```
17
```

### Input 2
```
(((()(()()))(())()))(()())
```

### Output 2
```
24
```
