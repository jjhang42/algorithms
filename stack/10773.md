## Problem

Captain Jaemin is keeping a ledger to prepare for a club dinner.

Jaehyun is helping manage the money, but he is unfortunately often distracted and frequently calls out the wrong numbers.

Every time Jaehyun makes a mistake, he shouts **0**, which means Jaemin must **remove the most recently written number** from the ledger.

After recording all the numbers (with errors removed), Jaemin wants to know the **final sum** of the values.  
Help Jaemin calculate it!

## Input

- The first line contains an integer `K` — the number of values recorded. (1 ≤ K ≤ 100,000)
- The next `K` lines each contain an integer between `0` and `1,000,000`.  
  - If the value is **0**, it means the most recent value should be erased.  
  - Otherwise, the value should be recorded.

It is guaranteed that whenever a `0` appears, there is a value available to remove.

---

## Output

Print the **sum of all remaining values** after processing the entire input.  
It is guaranteed that this sum does not exceed `2³¹ - 1`.

## Hint

Simulation for Example 2:

```
[1]  
[1, 3]  
[1, 3, 5]  
[1, 3, 5, 4]  
[1, 3, 5]      ← removed 4  
[1, 3]         ← removed 5  
[1, 3, 7]  
[1, 3]         ← removed 7  
[1]            ← removed 3  
[1, 6]
```

Final sum: 7
