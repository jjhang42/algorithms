## Problem

The KOI Communications Research Center is conducting experiments to develop a new secret communication system using lasers.  
For the experiment, **N** towers of different heights are arranged in a straight line from left to right.  
Each tower has a laser transmitter installed on top.

Every tower fires a laser **horizontally to the left**, parallel to the ground.  
Every tower can **receive** laser signals using a receiver installed on its body.

A laser fired from a tower can **only be received by the first taller tower** it hits in the left direction.

For example, suppose there are five towers with heights: `6 9 5 7 4`, arranged from left to right.  
All towers fire their lasers simultaneously to the left:

- The laser from the 5th tower (height 4) is received by the 4th tower (height 7),
- The laser from the 4th tower is received by the 2nd tower (height 9),
- The laser from the 3rd tower is also received by the 2nd tower,
- The lasers from the 2nd and 1st towers are not received by any towers.

Given the number of towers and their heights, write a program to determine **which tower receives the laser from each tower**.

---

## Input

- The first line contains an integer **N** (1 ≤ N ≤ 500,000), the number of towers.
- The second line contains **N** space-separated integers, the heights of the towers from left to right.
  - The height of each tower is a natural number not exceeding 100,000,000.

---

## Output

- Print **N** integers separated by spaces.
- For each tower, output the index (1-based) of the tower that receives its laser.
- If no tower receives the laser, print `0`.

## Example Input 1
```
5
6 9 5 7 4
```

## Example Output 1
```
0 0 2 2 4
```
