## Problem

The world must be well-balanced — like positive and negative, light and darkness, and left and right brackets.

Jeongmin’s task is to write a program to determine whether the brackets in a given string are well-balanced.

The types of brackets included in the string are round brackets `()` and square brackets `[]`.  
A string is considered balanced if it satisfies the following conditions:

1. Every left round bracket `(` must be paired only with a right round bracket `)`.
2. Every left square bracket `[` must be paired only with a right square bracket `]`.
3. Every right bracket must have a corresponding left bracket that can pair with it.
4. Bracket pairs must be in a one-to-one correspondence. In other words, one bracket cannot be paired with more than one bracket.
5. If there is a pair of matching brackets, the string between them must also be balanced.

Let’s help Jeongmin determine whether a given string is balanced.

## Input

Each string (excluding the last character) consists of English letters, spaces, round brackets `()`, and square brackets `[]`.  
Each string ends with a period `"."`, and its length does not exceed 100 characters.

The input terminates with a single period `"."` on a line by itself.

---

## Output

For each line, print `"yes"` if the string is balanced, otherwise print `"no"`.

## Example Input

```
So when I die (the [first] I will see in (heaven) is a score list).
[ first in ] ( first out ).
Half Moon tonight (At least it is better than no Moon at all].
A rope may form )( a trail in a maze.
Help( I[m being held prisoner in a fortune cookie factory)].
([ (([( [ ] ) ( ) (( ))] )) ]).
 .
.
```

## Example Output

```
yes
yes
no
no
no
yes
yes
```

## Hint

A string like `" ."` (with no brackets) is also considered balanced.
