## Problem

Implement a stack that stores integers and processes a sequence of commands given as input.

The commands are as follows:

- `push X` : Push integer `X` onto the stack.  
- `pop` : Remove and print the top element of the stack. If the stack is empty, print `-1`.  
- `size` : Print the number of elements in the stack.  
- `empty` : Print `1` if the stack is empty, otherwise print `0`.  
- `top` : Print the top element of the stack. If the stack is empty, print `-1`.

---

## Input

- The first line contains an integer `N` (1 ≤ N ≤ 10,000) — the number of commands.  
- Each of the next `N` lines contains a single command as described above.  
- All integers `X` are between `1` and `100,000`.  
- All commands are guaranteed to be valid as described.

---

## Output

For every command that requires output (`pop`, `size`, `empty`, `top`), print the result on a new line.

---

## Example

### Input
```
14
push 1
push 2
top
size
empty
pop
pop
pop
size
empty
pop
push 3
empty
top
```

### Output
```
2
2
0
2
1
-1
0
1
-1
0
3
```

### Input
```
7
pop
top
push 123
top
pop
top
pop
```

### Output
```
-1
-1
123
123
-1
-1
```
