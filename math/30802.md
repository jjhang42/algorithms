# Welcome Kit

**Time Limit:** 0.1 seconds  
**Memory Limit:** 1024 MB

On February 3, 2024, at the on-site Grand Arena, each participant will receive a welcome kit containing one T-shirt and one pen. The manufacturer of the kits accepts orders under the following conditions:

- There are six T-shirt sizes: S, M, L, XL, XXL, and XXXL.  
  T-shirts can only be ordered in bundles of **T** shirts of the same size.
- There is only one type of pen, which can be ordered either in bundles of **P** pens or individually.
- Among the **N** participants, the number of people requesting each T-shirt size is **S, M, L, XL, XXL,** and **XXXL**, respectively.
- T-shirts can have leftovers but must not be in shortage, and they must be distributed according to the requested sizes.  
- Pens must be exactly enough (no shortage or surplus).

Determine:  
1. The minimum number of T-shirt bundles (each of size **T**) that must be ordered.  
2. The maximum number of pen bundles (each of size **P**) that can be ordered, and the number of individual pens to order in that case.

## Input

- The first line contains the number of participants **N**  
  *(1 ≤ N ≤ 10^9)*

- The second line contains the number of requests for each T-shirt size: **S, M, L, XL, XXL, XXXL**, separated by spaces.  
  *(0 ≤ S, M, L, XL, XXL, XXXL ≤ N; S + M + L + XL + XXL + XXXL = N)*

- The third line contains two integers **T** and **P**, separated by a space, representing the bundle sizes for T-shirts and pens, respectively.  
  *(2 ≤ T, P ≤ 10^9)*

---

## Output

- The first line should output the **minimum number of T-shirt bundles** (each containing **T** shirts) that must be ordered.

- The second line should output two integers: the **maximum number of pen bundles** (each containing **P** pens) that can be ordered, and the number of **individual pens** to order in that case.
