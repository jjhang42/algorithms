## Problem

You have N cards. Each card has a number from 1 to N written on it, placed in a pile in order such that card 1 is at the top and card N is at the bottom.

Now, the following operations are repeated until only one card remains:

1. Discard the top card.
2. Move the new top card to the bottom of the pile.

For example, if N = 4, the cards are in the order 1 2 3 4.  
- Discard 1 → 2 3 4  
- Move 2 to bottom → 3 4 2  
- Discard 3 → 4 2  
- Move 4 to bottom → 2 4  
- Discard 2 → 4 remains

Given the number N, write a program to determine the number on the last remaining card.

## Input

The first line contains an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 500,000).

## Output

Print the number of the last remaining card.

## Example

### Input
```
