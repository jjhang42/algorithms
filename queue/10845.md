## Problem

Implement a queue that stores integers and processes the commands given as input.

There are six possible commands:

- `push X`: Push integer X to the queue.
- `pop`: Remove and print the front integer of the queue. If the queue is empty, print `-1`.
- `size`: Print the number of elements in the queue.
- `empty`: Print `1` if the queue is empty; otherwise, print `0`.
- `front`: Print the front element of the queue. If the queue is empty, print `-1`.
- `back`: Print the last element of the queue. If the queue is empty, print `-1`.

---

## Input

The first line contains the number of commands `N` (1 ≤ N ≤ 10,000).  
From the second line, each of the next `N` lines contains one command.  
All integers are between 1 and 100,000.  
All commands are valid as described above.

---

## Output

For every command that requires output, print the result on a separate line.
