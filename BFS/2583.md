## Problem

You are given a grid paper of size **M × N** with unit spacing (1). On this grid, **K** axis-aligned rectangles are drawn so that their sides lie on the grid lines. Consider the **rest of the paper excluding the interior of these K rectangles**. This remaining part is divided into several **disjoint regions**.

For example, if **M = 5**, **N = 7**, and three rectangles are drawn as in Figure 1, then the remaining area is divided into **three** separate regions as in Figure 2. The areas of these three separated regions are **1, 7, and 13**, respectively.

Given **M**, **N**, **K**, and the coordinates of the **K** rectangles, write a program to determine:
1. The number of separated regions in the remaining area, and  
2. The area (in number of unit cells) of each region, in ascending order.

## Input

- The first line contains three integers **M**, **N**, and **K** (1 ≤ M, N, K ≤ 100).  
  - The coordinate system has the lower-left corner at **(0, 0)** and the upper-right corner at **(N, M)**.
- Each of the next **K** lines contains four integers: **x1 y1 x2 y2**, which describe a rectangle with lower-left corner **(x1, y1)** and upper-right corner **(x2, y2)**.  
- It is guaranteed that the **K** rectangles do **not** cover the entire grid.

> Note: Rectangles are **open on the interior** for the purpose of removal—i.e., cells strictly inside a rectangle are excluded; borders are treated according to grid discretization (standard BOJ interpretation uses marking on lattice cells/units).

## Output

- On the first line, print the **number of regions**.  
- On the second line, print the **areas** of the regions in **ascending order**, separated by spaces.
