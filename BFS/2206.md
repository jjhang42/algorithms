## Problem Description

You are given a map represented as a matrix of size N×M. In this map:

- `0` represents a cell that can be moved to.
- `1` represents a wall that cannot be passed through.

You want to move from the top-left corner (1, 1) to the bottom-right corner (N, M) using the **shortest path**. The shortest path is defined as the path with the minimum number of cells passed, including both the starting and ending cells.

You are allowed to **break through exactly one wall** during the journey, **if doing so helps shorten the path**.

You can move to adjacent cells in 4 directions: up, down, left, and right (no diagonal movement).

Write a program that computes the minimum distance required to reach the goal. If it is not possible to reach the goal, output -1.

## Input

- The first line contains two integers **N** and **M** (1 ≤ N, M ≤ 1,000) — the number of rows and columns in the map.
- The next **N** lines each contain **M** characters of `0` or `1`, representing the map.
- You can assume that the starting point (1,1) and the destination (N,M) are always `0` (not walls).

## Output

- Output the minimum number of steps required to reach the destination.
- If it is not possible to reach the destination, output `-1`.
