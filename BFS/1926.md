## Problem

Given a large canvas containing drawings, output:
1) the number of **pictures**, and  
2) the area of the **largest** picture.

A **picture** is defined as a connected component of cells with value `1`.  
Connectivity is **4-directional** (up, down, left, right). Diagonals do **not** connect.  
The **area** of a picture is the number of `1` cells in that component.

---

## Input

- The first line contains two integers `n` and `m` (`1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500`) — the height and width of the canvas.
- The next `n` lines each contain `m` integers (`0` or `1`) separated by spaces, where `0` denotes an uncolored cell and `1` denotes a colored cell.

---

## Output

Print two lines:
1. The number of pictures.
2. The area of the largest picture. If there are no pictures, print `0` for the second line.
