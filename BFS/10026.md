## Problem

People with red-green color weakness cannot easily distinguish between red and green.  
Therefore, the way they see a picture may be different from how people without this condition see it.

You are given a picture represented by an N×N grid, where each cell is colored either **R (Red)**, **G (Green)**, or **B (Blue)**.  
The picture is divided into regions, where a region consists of connected cells of the same color. Two cells belong to the same region if they are adjacent vertically or horizontally and have the same color. (For color-weak people, red and green are considered the same color.)

For example, consider the picture below:

```
RRRBB
GGBBB
BBBRR
BBRRR
RRRRR
```

- A normal person sees **4 regions** (2 red, 1 green, 1 blue).  
- A red-green color-weak person sees **3 regions** (2 red-green combined, 1 blue).  

Write a program to calculate the number of regions seen by a normal person and by a color-weak person.

## Input

- The first line contains an integer **N** (1 ≤ N ≤ 100).  
- The next **N** lines each contain a string of length **N**, representing the picture.

---

## Output

Print two integers separated by a space:  
- The number of regions seen by a normal person.  
- The number of regions seen by a red-green color-weak person.
