## Problem

A knight is placed on a chessboard. The possible moves of a knight in one turn are shown in the diagram below. Given a target square, determine the minimum number of moves required for the knight to reach it.

---

## Input

The first line contains the number of test cases.  

Each test case consists of three parts:

1. An integer `l` (4 ≤ l ≤ 300), the length of one side of the chessboard. The board size is `l × l`.  
   Each square on the chessboard can be represented as a pair `{0, ..., l-1} × {0, ..., l-1}`.  

2. The knight's current position (two integers).  

3. The target position the knight wants to reach (two integers).  

---

## Output

For each test case, print the minimum number of moves required for the knight to reach the target square.
