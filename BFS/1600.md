Monkey Who Wants to Be a Horse — English Translation

A monkey that just escaped from the zoo is exploring the world. It desperately wants to become a horse. So it carefully watches how a horse moves and decides to imitate it. A horse moves on a grid like a chess knight. In the figure below, the cells marked with an x are the positions a horse can move to in one move. Note that a horse can jump over obstacles.

  x     x
x         x
    H

However, the monkey is mistaken about one thing. Although a horse can always move that way, the monkey can perform the horse-like (knight) move at most K times in total. For all other moves, it can only move to an adjacent cell in the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right). Diagonal moves do not count as adjacent.

The monkey starts its long journey from the top-left corner of the grid and must reach the bottom-right corner. One move to an adjacent cell counts as one action, and one horse-like move also counts as one action. Given the grid, write a program to determine the minimum number of actions needed for the monkey to go from the start to the destination.

If it is impossible to reach the destination, output -1.

Input

The first line contains an integer K.

The second line contains two integers W (width) and H (height).

The next H lines each contain W integers describing the grid:

0 means empty ground,

1 means an obstacle (cannot be entered).

The start cell (top-left) and the destination cell (bottom-right) are always empty ground.

Constraints: 1 ≤ W, H ≤ 200, 0 ≤ K ≤ 30.

Output

Print a single integer: the minimum number of actions required to reach the destination.

If it is impossible, print -1.
