## Problem

Cheolsu owns a large warehouse for storing tomatoes. Tomatoes are stored
in grid-shaped boxes inside the warehouse, one tomato per cell.

Some tomatoes may already be ripe, while others may still be unripe.
After one day, each ripe tomato will cause any adjacent unripe tomatoes
to also become ripe. Here, adjacency means the four directions: left,
right, front, and back. Diagonal adjacency does not count. Also, a
tomato cannot ripen on its own without influence.

Cheolsu wants to know how many days it will take until all the tomatoes
in the warehouse are ripe, or if that is impossible.

Given the dimensions of the storage box and the initial state of the
tomatoes, write a program to compute the minimum number of days required
for all the tomatoes to ripen. Some cells in the box may be empty (i.e.,
no tomato).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Input

The first line contains two integers `M` and `N`, the dimensions of the
box.\
- `M` is the number of columns (width).\
- `N` is the number of rows (height).\
Constraints: `2 ≤ M, N ≤ 1000`.

The next `N` lines each contain `M` integers describing the state of
each tomato in the box: - `1`: a ripe tomato\
- `0`: an unripe tomato\
- `-1`: no tomato in this cell

At least one tomato is guaranteed to be present.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Output

Print the minimum number of days required for all tomatoes to ripen.

-   If all tomatoes are already ripe at the start, print `0`.\
-   If it is impossible for all tomatoes to ripen, print `-1`.
