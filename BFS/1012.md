## Problem

Hannah, a next-generation farmer, decided to grow organic cabbages in the highlands of Gangwon Province.  
To cultivate cabbages without pesticides, it is important to protect them from pests. Hannah decided to use cabbage white worms, which live near the roots of cabbages and eat pests.  

If even one worm lives on a cabbage, it can move to adjacent cabbages, protecting them as well. Two cabbages are considered adjacent if they are directly connected **up, down, left, or right**.

Since the land is uneven, cabbages are planted in scattered plots. Only one worm is needed per connected group of cabbages. Therefore, the task is to determine the number of groups of cabbages in the field to know how many worms are required.

For example, given the following field (0 = empty, 1 = cabbage):

```
1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1
```

The minimum number of worms required is **5**.

## Input

- The first line contains an integer **T** (number of test cases).  
- For each test case:  
  - The first line contains three integers **M** (width), **N** (height), and **K** (number of cabbages).  
  - The next **K** lines each contain two integers **X** and **Y**, representing the position of a cabbage (0 ≤ X ≤ M-1, 0 ≤ Y ≤ N-1).  
  - No two cabbages occupy the same location.  

Constraints:  
- 1 ≤ M, N ≤ 50  
- 1 ≤ K ≤ 2500

## Output

For each test case, print the minimum number of worms required.
