# Fire! (Problem 4179)

**Time Limit**: 1 second\
**Memory Limit**: 256 MB

Jihoon works in a maze. Help him escape!

Given Jihoon's position and the locations of fire in the maze, determine
whether Jihoon can escape before being caught by fire, and if so, how
quickly he can escape.

Jihoon and the fire both move one cell per minute, horizontally or
vertically (not diagonally).

The fire spreads from each burning cell to its four adjacent cells.

Jihoon can escape if he reaches any space adjacent to the boundary of
the maze.

Neither Jihoon nor the fire can pass through walls.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Input

-   The first line contains two integers **R** and **C** separated by a
    space (1 ≤ R, C ≤ 1000).
    -   **R** is the number of rows in the maze.\
    -   **C** is the number of columns in the maze.
-   The next **R** lines each represent a row of the maze.

Each character in the input has the following meaning:\
- `#` : Wall\
- `.` : Open space (can move through)\
- `J` : Jihoon's starting position (also an open space)\
- `F` : Fire's starting position

There will be exactly one `J` in the input.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Output

-   If Jihoon cannot escape before the fire reaches him, print:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
    IMPOSSIBLE

-   If Jihoon can escape, print the minimum time (in minutes) it takes
    for him to escape.
