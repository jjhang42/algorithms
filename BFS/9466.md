## Problem

Students who registered for the "Problem Solving" course this fall
semester are required to carry out a term project.\
There is no limit on the number of members in a project team. In fact,
it is even possible for there to be only one team that contains all the
students.

To form a project team, every student must choose exactly one other
student with whom they want to work. (It is also possible for a student
who wants to work alone to choose themselves.)

Let the students be denoted as (s1, s2, ..., sr). They can form a valid
team only in the following two cases:

1.  When **r = 1** and student **s1 chooses themselves**, or\
2.  When **s1 chooses s2, s2 chooses s3, ..., sr-1 chooses sr, and sr
    chooses s1** (i.e., they form a cycle).

For example, suppose there are 7 students in a class, numbered from 1 to
7. If the choices are given as follows:

  Student   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
  --------- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
  Chosen    3   1   3   7   3   4   6

From this result, students (3) and (4, 7, 6) can form valid teams.\
Students 1, 2, and 5 do not belong to any team.

Given the results of the students' choices, write a program that
calculates the number of students who do not belong to any project team.

## Input

-   The first line contains an integer **T**, the number of test cases.\
-   For each test case:
    -   The first line contains an integer **n** (2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), the
        number of students.\
    -   The second line contains **n** integers, representing the chosen
        student number for each student. (Every student is numbered from
        1 to n.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Output

For each test case, print a single line with the number of students who
cannot belong to any project team.
