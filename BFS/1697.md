## Problem

Subin is playing hide and seek with her younger sibling.  
Subin is currently at position **N** (0 ≤ N ≤ 100,000), and her sibling is at position **K** (0 ≤ K ≤ 100,000).  

Subin can either **walk** or **teleport**:  
- If Subin is at position `X` and chooses to walk, after 1 second she moves to either `X - 1` or `X + 1`.  
- If Subin chooses to teleport, after 1 second she moves to position `2 * X`.  

Given Subin’s and her sibling’s positions, write a program to determine the **minimum time (in seconds)** it takes for Subin to reach her sibling.  

---

## Input

The first line contains two integers **N** and **K**, representing Subin’s and her sibling’s positions, respectively.  

---

## Output

Print the minimum time (in seconds) required for Subin to reach her sibling.  

---

## Example

### Input 1
```
5 17
```

### Output 1
```
4
```

---

## Hint

One possible path is: 5 → 10 → 9 → 18 → 17, which takes 4 seconds.
