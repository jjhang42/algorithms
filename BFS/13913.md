# Hide and Seek 4 — Special Judge

**Time Limit:** 2 seconds  
**Memory Limit:** 512 MB

Subin is playing hide-and-seek with her younger sibling.  
Subin is currently at point **N** (0 ≤ N ≤ 100,000), and her sibling is at point **K** (0 ≤ K ≤ 100,000).

Subin can either **walk** or **teleport**.  
If Subin is at position `X`:
- By walking, she can move to `X - 1` or `X + 1` after 1 second.
- By teleporting, she can move to `2 * X` after 1 second.

Given Subin’s position and her sibling’s position, write a program that computes:

1. The **minimum time (in seconds)** required for Subin to find her sibling.  
2. One of the possible **shortest movement paths** Subin can take to reach her sibling.

## Input

The first line contains two integers `N` and `K` — Subin’s starting position and her sibling’s position.

## Output

- On the first line, print the **minimum time** needed to reach `K` from `N`.  
- On the second line, print the **sequence of positions** (path) from `N` to `K` separated by spaces.

## Example

### Example Input 1
```
5 17
```

### Example Output 1
```
4
5 10 9 18 17
```

### Example Input 2
```
5 17
```

### Example Output 2
```
4
5 4 8 16 17
```
