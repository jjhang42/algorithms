## Problem

Subin is playing hide-and-seek with her younger sibling. Subin is currently at position $N$ ($0 \le N \le 100,000$) and her sibling is at position $K$ ($0 \le K \le 100,000$). Subin can either walk or teleport.

If Subin is at position $X$:
1.  **Walking:** She can move to $X-1$ or $X+1$ in **1 second**.
2.  **Teleporting:** She can move to $2 \times X$ in **0 seconds**.

Given Subin's position $N$ and her sibling's position $K$, write a program to find the fastest time (in seconds) it takes for Subin to find her sibling.

## Input

The first line contains two integers $N$ and $K$, representing Subin's starting position and her sibling's position, respectively.

## Output

Print the fastest time (in seconds) it takes for Subin to find her sibling.

## Example 1

| Input | Output |
| 5 17  |    2   |

### Hint

The path $5 \to 10 \to 9 \to 18 \to 17$ allows Subin to find her sibling in 2 seconds.
* $5 \xrightarrow{\text{teleport}} 10$ (0 seconds)
* $10 \xrightarrow{\text{walk}} 9$ (1 second)
* $9 \xrightarrow{\text{teleport}} 18$ (0 seconds)
* $18 \xrightarrow{\text{walk}} 17$ (1 second)
* Total time: $0 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 2$ seconds.
