## Problem

The number **666** is known as the "number of the apocalypse."  
Because of this, many blockbuster movie titles include the number 666.

Shom is the director of a film series titled *The End of the World*.  
When George Lucas created *Star Wars*, he named them *Star Wars 1*, *Star Wars 2*, ..., *Star Wars 6*.  
Similarly, Peter Jackson titled his films *The Lord of the Rings 1*, *2*, and *3*.  

But Shom wants to prove he’s above both of them, so he chose a different naming method.  

An **apocalyptic number** is defined as any number that contains **at least three consecutive sixes (`666`)** in its digits.  
The smallest such number is **666**, followed by **1666**, **2666**, **3666**, and so on.  

Therefore, Shom names his first movie *The End of the World 666*,  
his second movie *The End of the World 1666*,  
his third *The End of the World 2666*, and so forth.  

Your task is to **find the N-th apocalyptic number**.
