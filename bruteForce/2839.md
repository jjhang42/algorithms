## Problem

Sang-geun is now working at a sugar factory, delivering sugar.  
He has to deliver exactly **N kilograms** of sugar to a candy shop.

The sugar comes in only **5 kg** and **3 kg** bags.

Sang-geun is lazy and wants to carry the **fewest number of bags** possible.  
For example, to deliver 18 kg of sugar, he could carry six 3 kg bags.  
However, using three 5 kg bags and one 3 kg bag (total of 4 bags) is better.

Write a program to determine the **minimum number of bags** needed to exactly deliver **N kg** of sugar.

If it is **not possible** to make exactly N kg using only 3 kg and 5 kg bags, print `-1`.

## Input

A single integer `N` is given. (3 ≤ N ≤ 5000)

---

## Output

Print the minimum number of bags Sang-geun must carry.  
If it is impossible to deliver exactly N kilograms, print `-1`.
