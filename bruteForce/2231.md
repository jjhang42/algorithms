## Problem

Given a natural number **N**, its *decomposition sum* is defined as the number **N** plus the sum of its digits.
For example, the decomposition sum of **245** is:
245 + 2 + 4 + 5 = 256

So, **245** is called a *constructor* of **256**.
Note that:
- Some numbers may have no constructor.
- Some numbers may have multiple constructors.

Your task is to find the **smallest constructor** of a given number **N**.

---

## Input

A single integer **N** (1 ≤ N ≤ 1,000,000) is given.

---

## Output

Print the smallest constructor **M** such that:
M + sum_of_digits(M) = N

If no such **M** exists, print `0`.

## Example

### Input
216

### Output
198
