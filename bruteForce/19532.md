## Problem

Su-hyun is a middle school student living in the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Due to COVID-19, Su-hyun attends virtual school, where she takes virtual classes. Her virtual teacher gave a lecture on solving systems of linear equations with two variables and assigned the following problem as homework.

Solve for $x$ and $y$ in the following system of equations:

\[
\begin{cases}
ax + by = c \\
dx + ey = f
\end{cases}
\]

Believing that meeting virtual friends in the virtual world is more worthwhile than doing homework in this era, Su-hyun doesn’t want to solve these equations herself. Fortunately, submitting homework only requires entering numbers into blank fields in a web browser. Each field only accepts integers between -999 and 999.

Let’s help Su-hyun enter the correct answers so she can go off to meet her virtual friends.

## Input

You are given six integers:  
`a b c d e f` separated by spaces.  
All values satisfy: -999 ≤ a, b, c, d, e, f ≤ 999

It is guaranteed that the system of equations has exactly one solution `(x, y)` such that both x and y are integers in the range -999 to 999.

---

## Output

Print the integers `x` and `y` that solve the equations, separated by a space.

## Examples

### Input 1
1 3 -1 4 1 7

### Output 1
2 -1

### Input 2
2 5 8 3 -4 -11

### Output 2
