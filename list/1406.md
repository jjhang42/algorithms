## Problem

You are to implement a simple line-based text editor.  
This editor can only contain lowercase English letters, and it supports up to 600,000 characters.

The editor uses a **cursor**, which can be located:
- At the beginning of the line (to the left of the first character),
- At the end of the line (to the right of the last character),
- Or anywhere in between two characters in the line.

If the current string has length `L`, the cursor can be in `L + 1` possible positions.

The editor supports the following commands:

- `L` : Move the cursor one position to the left (ignored if already at the beginning)
- `D` : Move the cursor one position to the right (ignored if already at the end)
- `B` : Delete the character to the left of the cursor (ignored if already at the beginning)
  - After deletion, the cursor behaves as if it has moved left, but characters to the right remain unchanged.
- `P $` : Insert the character `$` to the left of the cursor.

Initially, the cursor is located at the **end** of the input string.  
You are to process the given commands in order and print the final resulting string.

## Input

- The first line contains the initial string (length ≤ 100,000), made up of lowercase letters.
- The second line contains an integer `M` — the number of commands. (1 ≤ M ≤ 500,000)
- The next `M` lines each contain one command from the list above.

---

## Output

Print the string in the editor after all commands have been processed.
