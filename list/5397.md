## Problem

Chang-young has installed a keylogger on Kang-san's computer to steal his password.  
After several days, he has finally captured the keystrokes Kang-san entered into the password field.

The keylogger records **every key press**, including **arrow keys** and **backspaces**,  
so it can fully reconstruct what was typed—even if corrections were made.

Given the sequence of key inputs Kang-san typed, write a program to determine his actual password.  
The key inputs may include uppercase/lowercase letters, digits, backspace, and arrow keys.

## Input

- The first line contains an integer `T` — the number of test cases.  
- Each of the next `T` lines contains a string representing a sequence of key inputs.  
  The length of each string is `L`, where `1 ≤ L ≤ 1,000,000`.

**Special characters:**
- `-` represents **Backspace**: deletes the character to the **left** of the cursor, if any.
- `<` represents **Left Arrow**: moves the cursor one position to the left, if possible.
- `>` represents **Right Arrow**: moves the cursor one position to the right, if possible.
- Other characters are treated as normal input characters (part of the password).  
  If typed in the middle, existing characters to the right of the cursor shift accordingly.

## Output

For each test case, print the resulting password after applying all keystrokes.  
The length of the final password is always greater than 0.
