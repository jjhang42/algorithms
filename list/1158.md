## Problem

The **Josephus problem** is defined as follows:

There are `N` people standing in a circle, numbered from `1` to `N`.  
Starting from the first person, a positive integer `K` (≤ N) is given, and every `K`-th person is removed from the circle.  
After one person is removed, counting resumes from the next person still remaining in the circle, and this process continues until all people are removed.

The order in which the people are removed forms the **Josephus permutation** of `(N, K)`.

For example, the Josephus permutation of `(7, 3)` is:

```
<3, 6, 2, 7, 5, 1, 4>
```

Given `N` and `K`, write a program to print the Josephus permutation.

---

## Input

A single line containing two integers `N` and `K` separated by a space.  
`1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 5000`

---

## Output

Print the Josephus permutation in the format:

```
<value1, value2, ..., valueN>
```

---

## Example

### Input
```
7 3
```

### Output
```
<3, 6, 2, 7, 5, 1, 4>
```
